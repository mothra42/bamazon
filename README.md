# bamazon

This app is fairly simple.

There are three main pathways a user can take. On startup they can choose to be a customer, manager, or supervisor.

A customer is thrown into the buying loop where they can buy items from the store.
The manager can restock the store, look at low inventory, look at all inventory, and add new products.
The supervisor can look at total sales across all departments and add new departments with overhead costs.

this app works using inquirer, easy-table and mysql npm packages.
